## Problem Overview
<p align="justify">The Garment Industry is one of the key examples of the industrial globalization of this modern era. It is a highly labour-intensive industry with lots of manual processes. Satisfying the huge global demand for garment products is mostly dependent on the production and delivery performance of the employees in the garment manufacturing companies. The main problem often faced by the garment industry is that employees cannot meet the productivity that has been targeted, causing losses such as the number of good products produced is less than the target, delays in completing products from a predetermined time period, and the level of customer satisfaction decreases. So, it is highly desirable among the decision makers in the garments industry to track, analyse and predict the productivity performance of the working teams in their factories using data driven approach. Through the data approach, predictive models can be made using one of the machine learning algorithms, namely linear regression. With this predictor of employee productivity, management can carry out production planning more accurately and efficiently in terms of costs.</p>

## Objective & Method
1. Create garment employee's productivity predictor
   
   Create predictive model using linear regression machine learning algorithm. In this project we will use several method of linear regression, that are :
   * Multiple Linear Regression
   * Ridge Regression
   * Lasso Regression
   * Random Forest Regression
   * Deep Learning
2. Analyze the variable that affect garment employee's productivity 
   
   Perform exploratory data analysis processes to analyze :
   * Correlation among other variables
   * Determine effective and efficient variable standard to achieve high productivity (> targeted productivity)

## Dataset 
<p align="justify">This project using productivity prediction of garment employee dataset (Source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishadss/productivity-prediction-of-garment-employees). This dataset contains 1197 rows and 15 columns. This dataset includes important attributes of the garment manufacturing process and the productivity of the employees which had been collected manually and also been validated by the industry experts. </p>
