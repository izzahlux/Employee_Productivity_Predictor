# Employee_Productivity_Predictor
<p align="justify">The Garment Industry is one of the key examples of the industrial globalization of this modern era. It is a highly labour-intensive industry with lots of manual processes. Satisfying the huge global demand for garment products is mostly dependent on the production and delivery performance of the employees in the garment manufacturing companies. So, it is highly desirable among the decision makers in the garments industry to track, analyse and predict the productivity performance of the working teams in their factories.</p>

## About
<p align="justify">This project using productivity prediction of garment employee dataset (Source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishadss/productivity-prediction-of-garment-employees). This dataset contains 1197 rows and 15 columns. This dataset includes important attributes of the garment manufacturing process and the productivity of the employees which had been collected manually and also been validated by the industry experts. </p>

## Objective 
create a regression model that can predict the productivity performance of the working teams and has the best performance 

## Requirements
